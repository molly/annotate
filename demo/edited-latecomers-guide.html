         By Kevin Roose, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/18/technology/cryptocurrency-crypto-guide.html">originally published</a> in <i>The New York Times</i> on March 20, 2022</div>

         Annotations by Molly White, Matt Binder, Grady Booch, Amy Castor, Stephen Diehl, Dirty Bubble Media, Dr. Catherine Flick, David Gerard, Geoffrey Huntley, Bennett Tomlin, Neil Turkewitz, Ed Zitron, and some anonymous contributors. Published March 25, 2022.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        On March 20, 2022, the <i>New York Times</i> published a 14,000-word puff piece on cryptocurrencies, both 
        online and as an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220401215134/https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1505582695287468036">entire section of the Sunday print edition</a>. Though 
        its author, Kevin Roose, wrote that it aimed to be a "sober, dispassionate explanation of what crypto actually
        <i>is</i>", it was a thinly-veiled advertisement for cryptocurrency that appeared to have received little
        in the way of fact-checking or critical editorial scrutiny. It uncritically repeated many questionable or 
        entirely fallacious arguments from cryptocurrency advocates, and it appears that no experts on the topic
        were consulted, or even anyone with a less-than-rosy view on crypto. This is grossly irresponsible.
      </p>
      <p>Here, a group of around <a href="#contributors">fifteen cryptocurrency researchers and critics</a> have done what the <i>New York Times</i> apparently won't.</p>

            <div class="commenter">Molly White</div>Crypto skeptic Ben McKenzie has argued that this is a sign that the bubble has become precariously large, not that crypto has become ubiquitous: "The celebrities are a symptom of a much bigger problem... You've got all this money and you're trying to get it out to more people and get more people to buy. And if one were to compare cryptocurrency to, say, an MLM or a ponzi, then you would need ever more people to come in to keep the thing going. Celebrities are sort of the natural endpoint for that. At its biggest, you need the biggest: you need Matt Damon and Larry David and sports stars to sell it." (<a href="https://youtu.be/AijwGyNLtjc?t=865"><i>Crypto Critics' Corner</i>, episode 51</a>)

           Crypto! For years, it seemed like the kind of fleeting tech trend most people could safely ignore, like hoverboards or Google Glass.

              <div class="commenter">Molly White</div>As David Gerard wrote in his 2017 book <i>Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain</i>, "Cryptocurrency advocates and lazy journalists like to talk about the 'market cap' of crypto, which is the total number of coins or tokens in existence multiplied by today's price. This is a bogus number that's not actually applicable to anything — it's not money that was put into the crypto, it's not a realisable value like a company market cap, it doesn't affect prices — it's just an easily-calculated number that sounds good in a headline. Trading is so thin in any crypto, even Bitcoin, that you could never realise a fraction of the number."

           As it’s gone mainstream, crypto has inspired an unusually polarized discourse. Its biggest fans think it’s saving the world, while its biggest skeptics are convinced it’s all a scam — an environment-killing speculative bubble orchestrated by grifters and sold to greedy dupes, which will probably crash the economy when it bursts.</div>

           I’ve been writing about crypto for nearly a decade, a period in which <mark  aria-details="rooses-views">my own views have whipsawed between extreme skepticism and cautious optimism.

            <p>This is a statement desperately in need of some links. Although Roose has linked to his own writing quite liberally throughout this article, it certainly doesn't show "extreme skepticism", nor for that matter does his optimism seem particularly cautious. This article notably doesn't seem to link to his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/technology/penguin-nft-club.html">August 2021 <i>Times</i> article about the "Pudgy Penguins" NFT project</a>, which served to lend the project legitimacy and pump the price before the group later attempted to scam a prospective buyer of the company. No follow-up was ever published—this is a recurring theme for the articles Roose writes about various crypto projects, as you will see throughout this commentary.</p>
            <p>Roose has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220219172535/https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1495085866192027655">publicly advocated</a> for journalists who write about crypto to be able to buy and sell cryptocurrencies and NFTs, despite himself acknowledging the "strong biasing effect" it would have and that the traditional finance equivalent of this behavior is prohibited by most reputable publications. He holds the <code>cryptoroose.eth</code> <a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/ethereum-name-service-ens-explained-guide-learn">ENS domain</a> (which he <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdd58208d954f61ed181899d4380266246eb483c8e0cb6bf2d471cc4fb64708e1">bought</a> in October for $21... plus another $136 in transaction fees). He uses the associated wallet for transactions relating to his reporting, including the $500,000 sale of an NFT representing a <i>Times</i> article that he mentions in this piece, the receipt of some Pudgy Penguins NFTs from the creator of the project (later returned), and similar.</p>

Whether or not you agree with the philosophy/economics behind cryptocurrencies, they are — simply put — a software architecture disaster in the making.

              <p>Notwithstanding that, yes, competent criminals can absolutely use crypto for illicit activity—isn't the flip side of this argument that blockchain ledgers are fundamentally privacy-less? If the argument is that it's easy to track criminals through crypto ledgers, then it would be easy to track anyone through them. Especially the average person, who doesn't know how to obfuscate their activity.</p>
              <p>In what universe is it a good idea for everyone's financial transactions to be publicly available (especially to, as this very sentence implies, to law enforcement)? "Debunking" this anti-crypto argument only forms a stronger, much more critical one.</p>

          <p>Crypto boosters will likely quibble with my explanations, while dug-in opponents may find them too generous. That’s OK. My goal is not to convince you that crypto is good or bad, that it should be outlawed or celebrated, or that investing in it will make you rich or bankrupt you. It is simply to demystify things a bit. And if you want to go deeper, each section has a list of reading suggestions at the end.</p>

          <h3>Crypto will be transformative</h3>
          <p>Understanding crypto now — <mark aria-details="naturally-skeptical">especially if you’re naturally skeptical</mark> — is important for a few reasons.</p>

            <p>While I appreciate Kevin’s attempt to “explain” crypto to the masses, his very introduction is problematic. Why would understanding crypto be of particular importance for the “naturally skeptical?” Wouldn’t it make more sense to posit that understanding crypto was of greater immediate importance to those likely to invest money that perhaps they couldn’t afford to lose? Isn’t it more likely that the “naturally skeptical” are probably more familiar with how crypto works than the “naturally embracing” given the amount of pro-crypto propaganda to which we are constantly bombarded? And even the use of the term “naturally” is itself intriguing and telling—suggesting that skepticism is likely to stem from a certain form of romantic and emotional uniformed resistance to change a la Larry David rather than from the application of reason and the too-rare employment of critical thinking.</p>
            <p>To fully explain crypto to the masses, one might be forgiven for thinking that priority number one should be to carefully and fully describe the manifest financial risks, and to explain to the innocent how crypto is anchored in, and supports, a vision of society in which public institutions and functions are replaced by private parties. And how that vision naturally aligns with, and advances, a political agenda that undermines progressive ideas of society and government, regardless of one’s personal views of how it might be employed to advance a particular noble or progressive cause. Kevin wants us to know that not every person that invests in crypto does so out of pure selfishness, or to support regressive frameworks of governance. That is undoubtedly true, but it entirely misses the point. </p>

What strikes me looking back at tech journalism of the 2000s is how fast Facebook (to take the most prominent example) was growing: zero to 500 million users in just five years. I'm not sure any analysis or criticism, no matter how damning, could have slowed that kind of planetary momentum — and there was plenty of good analysis and criticism of Facebook at the time.

              <p>The last near-decade of tech journalism has almost started to do a decent job of questioning the financial incentives of companies that collect massive amounts of user data to profit off its customers.

Survey respondents were polled from October 19-November 16, 2020, and included 921 self-identifying current cryptocurrency owners and 1,697 consumers who were interested in learning more about cryptocurrency."

          <h4>Let’s start from the beginning: What is crypto?</h4>
          <p>A decade or two ago, the word was generally used as shorthand for cryptography. But in recent years, it’s been more closely associated with cryptocurrencies. These days, “crypto” usually refers to the entire universe of technologies that involve blockchains — the distributed ledger systems that power digital currencies like Bitcoin, but also serve as the base layer of technology for things like <mark aria-details="nfts-web3">NFTs, web3 applications and DeFi trading protocols.</mark></p>

          <p>Sorry, Cardi. The dollar is the world’s reserve currency, and dislodging it would be a huge, costly project that isn’t likely to happen any time soon. (To give just one small example of the enormity of the task: every financial contract that is denominated in dollars would have to be re-denominated in Bitcoin or Ether or some other cryptocurrency.</p>

              <p>While this is far from the most dangerous part of Kevin’s formulation of the “truth of crypto,” it is the one that strikes closest to home for me personally. Decentralization as a theoretical tool for empowering artists has been a feature of the advocacy landscape since the arrival of Napster in 1999. It has proven to be both illusory and wildly exploitative. The tools for decentralization—for bypassing gatekeepers, have existed for more than two decades. There is nothing new about crypto to aid in this putative empowerment. The problem that artists confront is that the asset which they create/own has virtually no value given decades of a dominant idea, peddled by many of the same advocates for web3/crypto, that “information wants to be free.” But capacity to individually create and distribute is not synonymous with empowerment when it fails to produce revenue that sustains creators. And don’t get me started on NFTs. NFTs solve none of these problems. Basically, they’re like telling artists—your music isn’t worth anything, but perhaps you can monetize this unique digital collectible. The NFT is a gimmick, not an asset.</p>
              <p>Now it’s all fine and good for Kevin to say that “some proponents will say” that decentralization will empower artists. That’s a true statement. Some people will say that Trump was the greatest president in US history. That is also a true statement of the views of “some people.” But it is beyond irresponsible to fail to interrogate this claim, and the lessons of history in demonstrating its failures.</p>

            <p>It is and always has been possible to do this since the internet started. Artists take commissions and exchange digital assets all the time. Artists design tattoos, musicians create soundtracks, 3D modelers build assets, etc. There is absolutely nothing stopping an artist from setting up a website where they charge $250 to draw a custom picture of a rabbit or whatever.</p>
            <p>Artists (to a certain extent) <i>want</i> those "gatekeepers" because they are platforms that bring in an audience or automate some complicated task like inventory management or product hosting. But if you really want to cut out the middleman, it's more than possible. For example, <i>MST3K</i> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mystery-science-theater-3000-mst3k-season-13-trailer-date-movies-cast-how-to-watch">just announced</a> their own streaming platform just to host their newest season.</p>

              <p>One of the best traits of a good tech reporter is someone who is able to evaluate something in terms of a regular person and translate a complex topic into simple terms. Kevin is actually good at this — he really is — and I'm disappointed that this is not on its own a huge deal. </p>
              <p>It takes literally seconds from me grabbing my phone from my pocket to send $5 on Square Cash, with maybe 3 actual "buttons" (and bits can be done via Face ID) — that is the speed of the actual work I have to do, and the transaction, again, takes seconds.</p>
              <p>In the case of a crypto transaction, it's incredibly important to add that "sending money" can mean a lot of things, and that you are "sending" it and have to pay to send it, and then once it's sent, it has to be recorded and depending on how they <i>received</i> it may take more confirmations before you can actually receive the money.</p>
              <p>The comparison here is different because the experience of <i>using</i> money is different. When I receive $5 from Square Cash, I can get that in my bank in a second using the same refund mechanism that Coinbase uses. If someone sends me $5 of Eth on Coinbase, I need to wait for confirmations.</p>
              <p>It's just so much more wonky than he's making it seem.</p>

           I was a religion reporter once, and I don’t think the comparison is totally inapt.

           It’s fun to laugh at the (often <a href="https://mashable.com/article/randi-zuckerberg-crypto-parody-music-videos">cringeworthy</a>) ways crypto fans try to entertain and inspire each other. But focusing too much on their behavior and customs might mean missing what’s genuinely novel — and, depending on where you sit, either exciting or dangerous — about the technology itself. Which is why, when my friends ask me how to talk to their cryptopilled relatives, I advise them to start by trying to understand what’s gotten them so excited in the first place.</div>
